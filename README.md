## 🚀 New in Version 2.0

The new **webhook scraper** uses robust regex to scan and collect valid Discord webhook URLs from public HTML content. It supports:
- `discord.com/api/webhooks/...`
- `ptb.discord.com/...` and `canary.discord.com/...`

> It saves the results to a file of your choice — ideal for managing leaked or public-facing webhooks.
